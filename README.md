# Modern Typescript template project

## Summary

This repo contains a template Typescript project, with the following setup:

- Typescript with strict checks enabled
- ESLint with additional checks for Typescript
- Prettier for formatting
- Jest with swc backend for testing
- ESM and ES2022 in built code
- Github action CI checks for linting, formatting, types and tests

It is intended for backend projects, as it is not setup to build for the web or handle React etc.
